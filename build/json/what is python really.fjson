That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Python is <strong>dynamically</strong> typed, this means that you don\u2019t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=\u201dI\u2019m a string\u201d without error</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Python is well suited to <strong>object orientated programming</strong> in that it allows <strong>the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance</strong>. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++\u2019s public, private), the justification for this point is given as \u201cwe are all adults here\u201c</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>in Python, <strong>functions are first-class objects</strong>. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Writing Python <strong>code is quick</strong> but running it is often <em>slower</em> than compiled languages. Fortunately\uff0c Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this, it\u2019s really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn\u2019t actually done by Python</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Python finds use in many spheres - <strong>web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data</strong> applications and many more. It\u2019s also often used as \u201cglue\u201d code to get other languages and components to play nice</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
